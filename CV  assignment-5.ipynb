The decay rate should be set to a value that will sufficiently reduce the learning rate over time, while not reducing it so quickly that the model is unable to learn effectively. Finally, the decay step should be set to a value that will allow for a sufficient reduction in learning rate over time, while not reducing it too quickly."

This can help prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights and providing a smoother fit to the data. Regularization techniques can be used to fine-tune a model’s parameters by adjusting the penalty applied to large weights, or by introducing a penalty for large weights. Regularization techniques can also be used to reduce the likelihood of overfitting by forcing the model to be more general."
